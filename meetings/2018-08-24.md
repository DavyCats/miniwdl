Mike looked at options for the implementation language of miniwdl. We had talked previously about a few concerns:

1. Languages with features that support parser implementation
2. Ease of distribution
3. Supporting python developers

Mike thinks just using python directly is the best option. Writing the parser in, say, rust, and wrapping that with python would be challenging because of the large surface area of interaction between the python and rust layers. It's not like python would be calling a few rust methods; it would be interacting closely with a data model implemented in rust that would more or less require a full second implementation in the python "wrapper". So concern (3) argues for python.

Newer type checking tools help with concern (1). And if the target, at least at first, is developers, then concern (2) is less serious. Longer term, we'll have to address it though.
